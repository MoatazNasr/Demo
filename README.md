# Vizuara-Teacher-Dashboard

This repo will be used for creating the Teacher Dashboard for Vizuara.

For now, some videos have been added to in the Class 7 and Class 9 folders in the 'Videos' section of the storage.

The format for Sketches/Mindmaps would be .png/.jpg/.gif files

The format for 3D Models, Virtual Laboratories and Pop Quiz would be a URL which has to be embedded as an Iframe.
